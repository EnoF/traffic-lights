# Exercise One
Test needs to be inside of an test suite. For now we will setup all the test preconditions
inside the test.

In this exercise we will use the following functions from `chai`:
 - expect
 - to
 - equal

With `chai` you are able to chain `expected` values to an assertion.

Example:
```javascript
expect(true).to.equal(true);
```

## should turn the traffic lights to green
Implement the test to check if the function `go`, sets the color to `GREEN`.

## should turn the traffic lights to red
Implement the test to check if the function `stop`, sets the color to `RED`.
